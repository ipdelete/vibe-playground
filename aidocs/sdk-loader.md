# SdkLoader: Loading the Copilot SDK in Electron

## The Problem

`@github/copilot-sdk` is **ESM-only** and spawns `@github/copilot` CLI as a child process. This creates challenges in Electron:

1. **Asar incompatibility** — both the SDK and CLI must live on the real filesystem, not inside Electron's asar archive. They can't be bundled by webpack.
2. **Missing PATH in packaged apps** — GUI-launched Electron apps inherit a minimal system PATH that excludes `/usr/local/bin`, nvm, volta, fnm, and other Node version managers. `npm` isn't on PATH, so the globally-installed SDK can't be located via `npm prefix -g`.
3. **Fresh machine installs** — packaged apps run on machines with no global Copilot CLI/SDK and sometimes no Node/npm at all.

## Architecture

```
SdkLoader (singleton)
  │
  ├── ensureCopilotInstalled() → bootstrap local SDK/CLI using bundled Node+npm
  ├── getCopilotNodeModules()  → prefer local userData install, fallback to global
  ├── getNpmGlobalPrefix()     → 4-tier resolution to find npm global install
  ├── getGlobalNodeModules()   → maps prefix → node_modules dir (OS-aware)
  ├── getCopilotCliPath()      → finds @github/copilot JS entry point
  ├── loadSdk()                → ESM dynamic import of @github/copilot-sdk
  └── getSharedClient()        → singleton CopilotClient shared by all services
```

## Local Bootstrap (Tier 0)

Packaged apps ship a bundled Node+npm runtime and install `@github/copilot-sdk` into a userData-local prefix:

```
{userData}/copilot/node_modules/@github/copilot-sdk
```

`ensureCopilotInstalled()` runs npm with a local prefix and cache inside userData. `SdkLoader` prefers this local install before falling back to global locations.

When the CLI entrypoint is a `.js` file (e.g. `npm-loader.js`), the SDK would normally spawn it using `process.execPath`. In packaged builds with RunAsNode disabled, `SdkLoader` instead runs the CLI via the bundled Node binary and passes the JS entrypoint through `cliArgs`.

After bootstrap, cmux writes a lightweight `copilot` shim into `{userData}/copilot` (e.g. `copilot.cmd` on Windows). Workspace PTYs prepend this directory to PATH so `copilot login` works without a global install.

## npm Global Prefix Resolution (fallback, 4 tiers)

`getNpmGlobalPrefix()` tries four strategies in order, caching the first success:

### Tier 1: `npm_config_prefix` env var
Fast path — set automatically when running under `npm start`. Works in dev, not in packaged app.

### Tier 2: `npm prefix -g`
Shells out to npm with the current process PATH. Works in dev when npm is on PATH. Fails in packaged Electron where PATH is minimal.

### Tier 3: User's login shell PATH
Spawns the user's actual shell (`zsh -ilc "echo $PATH"` or equivalent) to get the real PATH including nvm/volta/fnm paths, then retries `npm prefix -g` with that PATH. Solves the macOS GUI-launch problem.

### Tier 4: Well-known prefix probing
Hardcoded fallback locations, directly checking for `@github/copilot-sdk/package.json`:

| Platform | Locations checked |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Windows** | User `~/.npmrc` prefix, Node.js builtin npmrc prefix, `%APPDATA%/npm` |
| **macOS** | `/usr/local` (Intel Homebrew), `/opt/homebrew` (Apple Silicon) |
| **Linux** | `/usr` |
| **nvm** | `~/.nvm/versions/node/*/` (newest first) |
| **volta** | `~/.volta/tools/image/node/*/` (newest first) |
| **fnm** | `~/.local/share/fnm/node-versions/*/installation/` (newest first) |

## ESM Dynamic Import

Webpack's static analysis would try to bundle any `import()` call. The SDK is ESM-only and must load from the global install at runtime. The workaround:

```typescript
// new Function hides import() from webpack, pathToFileURL ensures valid ESM URL
const sdkModule = await (
  new Function('url', 'return import(url)')(pathToFileURL(sdkEntry).href)
);
```

## Windows CLI Path Resolution

The SDK spawns the CLI via `child_process.spawn()`. On Windows, npm installs `.cmd` shims which can't be spawned without `shell: true`. Instead, `getCopilotCliPath()` resolves the `.js` entry point directly (`npm-loader.js`), which the SDK spawns as `node <path>`.

The CLI may be nested under the SDK's own `node_modules` (npm's default for scoped packages):
```
{globalModules}/@github/copilot-sdk/node_modules/@github/copilot/npm-loader.js
```

## Singleton Client

`getSharedClient()` maintains a single `CopilotClient` instance shared between:
- **CopilotService** — chat orchestrator sessions
- **AgentSessionService** — per-agent coding sessions

Concurrent-start protection via a `startPromise` guard prevents multiple `client.start()` calls racing. On failure, state is reset so the next call retries cleanly.
