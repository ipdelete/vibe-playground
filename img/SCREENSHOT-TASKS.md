# Screenshot Task List

Capture these screenshots for docs and README. Save each as the filename listed below in this `img/` folder.

**Tips:**
- Use a clean window (no clutter in terminals)
- Dark theme is the default — capture as-is
- Aim for ~1200px wide window for consistency
- Crop to the app window (no desktop background)
